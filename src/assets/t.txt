What were the chances? It
 would have to be a lot more 
 than 
 100 to 1. It was 
 likely even more than 1,000 to 1. The more
  
  he thought about it, the odds of it happening had to be more th
  an 10,000 to 1 and even 100,000 to 1. People often threw around 
  the chances of something happening as being 1,000,000 to 1 as an exa
  ggeration of an unlikely event, but he could see that they may actually 
  
  
  be accurate in this situation. Whatever the odds of it happening, he knew the
  y were big. What he didn't know was whether this happening was lucky or unlucky.




As the sun rose over the small town of Millfield, Alice couldn't
 help but feel a sense of excitement wash over her. It was the first 
 day of summer vacation, and she had big plans for the next few months.

Alice had always been an adventurous girl, and this summer was no different
. She had a long list of activities that she wanted to try, from hiking in th
e mountains to rafting down the river.

But first, Alice had to get through the first day. She grabbed her backpack and
 set off for her favorite spot in town - the old oak tree by the river. She had
  spent countless hours there over the years, reading, drawing, and just enjoyi
  ng the peaceful surroundings.

As she walked through the quiet streets, Alice couldn't help but feel a sense o
f nostalgia wash over her. It was the same route that she had taken every summer
 for as long as she could remember. It was like a tradition, one that she looke
 d forward to every year.

When she finally reached the oak tree, Alice settled in for a long day of rela
xing. She took out her sketchbook and pencils, and began to draw the beautiful scenery around her.

As the hours passed, Alice lost track of time. She was so focused on her art t
hat she barely noticed the sun setting behind the mountains. It wasn't until the crickets started chirping that she realized it was getting late.

Alice packed up her things and headed back home, already looking forward to the
 adventures that the summer had in store for her. She knew that it was going to 
 be a summer to remember, and she couldn't wait to see what the future held.



The sun was setting on the small town of Millfield, casting a warm glow over the
 houses and shops that lined the streets. As the last of the day's customers tric
 kled out of the bakery, Maria locked the door and turned the sign to "closed." 
 She had been working long hours to prepare for the town's annual summer festival, and she was looking forward to a well-deserved rest.

As Maria made her way home, she couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement for 
the upcoming event. The festival was the highlight of the year for Millfield, wi
th carnival rides, food stalls, and live music. It was a time for the whole town 
to come together and celebrate their community.

As Maria approached her front door, she was startled by a loud crash from behind 
her. She turned to see a group of teenagers huddled around a broken bottle on the 
ground, laughing and jeering. Maria's heart sank as she recognized her son, Jack, among them.

She marched over to the group and grabbed Jack by the arm, pulling him away from t
he others. "What are you doing here?" she demanded. "You're supposed to be at the l
ibrary, studying for your exams."

"Relax, Mom," Jack said, rolling his eyes. "It's just a little fun. The festival's
 coming up, and we wanted to celebrate early."

Maria's anger boiled over. "This is not how we celebrate," she snapped. "You're gr
ounded for the rest of the week, and you're not going to the festival. Do you understand me?"

Jack's face fell, but he knew better than to argue with his mother. He nodded and t
rudged off to his room, leaving Maria to wonder what had happened to her once-promising son.

As the days leading up to the festival passed, Maria tried her best to keep Jack on 
track. She made sure he was doing his homework and kept a close eye on him, hoping t
o prevent any more mischief.

Despite her efforts, Maria couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. 

She couldn't put her finger on it, but she had a sense that something was coming.

On the night of the festival, Maria was manning the bakery's booth, selling her famous c
herry tarts to a long line of customers. As she wrapped up another sale, she heard a commotion from across the fairground. She looked up to see Jack and his friends running towards her, looking panicked.

"Mom, you have to hide us," Jack panted, pulling her behind the booth. "We did somethi
ng really stupid, and we don't want to get in trouble."

Maria's heart sank as she realized that she had been right all along. Something had bee

n coming, and now it was here. She looked at her son, her heart full of disappointment and worry.

"What did you do?" she asked, trying to stay calm.

"We broke into the town hall and spray-painted graffiti on the walls," Jack admitted, 
 head hanging in shame. "We didn't mean to cause any harm, but we know we're going to get in trouble."

Maria's mind raced as she tried to come up with a plan. She knew that the police were on t
heir way, and she had to
